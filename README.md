# Pong Clone

This is a simple pong clone built with TypeScipt and deployed on Vercel. I worked on this project in order to learn the basics of the Canvas API.

## Vite
This project uses a frontend build tool called Vite. It allows for TypeScript files to be included as a source in HTML script tags among many other things. Check out the [documentation](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) if you are interested in using it.
